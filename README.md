# CoinMod
Code for Boring Coin Mod.  It adds a flippable coin to Minecraft.

This is the first Minecraft mod I've ever made, and I'm also new to programming in general, so don't be surprised if my code isn't great.

If you're looking to install the mod to play with in Minecraft, you should download it from Curseforge.

However, if you're looking to contribute to the project, you're in the right place.
